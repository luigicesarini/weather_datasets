### Extracting information from several open access datasets

[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bi5y7nR0azMbEcoTd-5jpOGhCitbu0449sYMWe00AW8/edit#gid=0)

The purpose is to find a way to "aggregate" and extract information from the datasets listed in the google doc (and more) that we deem relevant for insurance companies. Along the process is important to extrapolate from the data information that would be fruitful also to us.
The work should neither entail the elaboration of data that would consume the equivalent of time spent on a PhD thesis (downscaling, bias correction, etc.) nor should be as trivial as just downloading the data, something in the middle.
The idea is to be the intermediate step between the raw data and the final application of the data. We don't have to provide inside on how the return period is changing given climate chage, non stationarity, etc. but arrange the data in a way that would make easier reaching that point or in turn, would make our life easier in our research.

The environmental variables of interest are:  

* Temperature (daily min, max and mean)
* Precipitation (cumulative daily precipitation or better)
* Wind speed (daily mean, max)
* Hail (probability or anything else)
* Number of lighting bolt

Additional costraints are the region interested, which is Italy and the data that should have at least 10 years time span.

Initially, we could reverse engineer the problem starting from what we always wanted to see in the data but didn't have the time or the resources to make it happen.<br> 
Which data did you always wanted just one click away?  
An example of elaboration that comes to my mind out of sheer selfishness:

- AMS of daily precipitation
- POT of daily precipitation
- Creation of a database
